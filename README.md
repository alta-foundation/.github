# ALTA

**Augmented Life & Tactical Agent**

ALTA builds private intelligence systems for individuals operating at a high level of responsibility, capital, and strategic exposure.

This is not a product.

Each system is designed and configured individually for one person.

No shared models.  
No templates.  
No public platform.

When everything speaks, ALTA decides.
